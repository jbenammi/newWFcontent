<h4>Program Overview</h4>
<p>Welcome to the Coding Dojo Online Program! We are excited to work with you over the next 20 weeks as you learn the skills needed to become a self-sufficient developer. It is our goal to help you learn new technologies and develop coding literacy to become a self-sufficient developer. To best prepare yourself, please read and work through the material presented in this module.</p>
<h4>Our Platform</h4>
<p>The Coding Dojo Online program covers 20 weeks. Over this time you will go through 3 stacks- Web Fundamentals, Python, and a 2nd of your choice. Web Fundamentals will cover front end technologies over 4 weeks. Next comes the Python stack which will last 8 weeks. During the first 4 weeks, look forward to learning the language and your first framework Flask. In the final 4 weeks, you'll learn Django and look to earn your Black Belt. After Python you will be given the option to choose from any of the available stacks where you will learn an language and the technologies to develop full stack applications using it.</p>

<h4>Culture + Expectations</h4>
<h6>Attitude and Dedication</h6>
<p>A core tenet of Coding Dojo's philosophy is that building projects and learning from experience is the most effective way to develop confidence in the skills you are learning. With that said, our curriculum is designed to be completed in sequence, with assignments and content building off of eachother to reinforce concepts while continuously learning new things. The process of working through the assignments won't always be easy, which leads us to a second core Dojo Philosophy: Strength through Struggle. Certain insights need to be arrived at independantly in order for you to grasp their implications. There won't always be answersheets. That is okay! We think the time spent 'correcting' previous work is better spent working on the next piece of the platform. You will gain experience over time that will constantly improve your approach.</p>
<h6>Hours</h6>
<p>We expect about 20-25 hours of work each week to be successful in moving thorugh the platform. We expect many of you to put in substantial amounts of that onthe weekends and will have staff available to help you make progress during those times.</p>
<h6>Lecture</h6>
<p>Lecture will be 30-40 minutes at 5pm and 7pm PST. For lecture to be successful, we rely on FLIP learning.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Flexible environment: We use a variety of technologies to engage in different ways. Being familiar with them will be important for you to be succesful. Use the checklist in this module to be prepared!</li>
  <li>Learning culture: Lecture is going to be about exploring concepts in depth and how/why we do things, NOT about what concepts are. Read platform content ahead of time to be prepared! Bring questions and engage to help drive YOUR learning experience.</li>
  <li>Intentional content: As mentioned before, assignments build off of eachother to reinforce concepts and introduce new ones simultaneously.</li>
  <li>Professional educators: Instructors are here to curate your learnign experience and help you with important concepts for your success. Interact and provide feedback to enable them to help you as much as they can!</li>
</ul>
<h4>Learning Experience</h4>
<ul>
  <li>
    <h6>20 Minute Rule</h6>
    <p>The 20 minute rule is a framework that helps you make progress every day. Here's how it works: You are working on an assignment and hit a bug you don't know how to work through. Start a 20 minute timer. For the next 20 minutes develop debugging skills perusing the internet and platform for material to work through your issue. After 20 minutes have elapsed, head to the Slack channel and look for assistance from your cohortmates and staff. The 20 minute rule has a lot of benefits:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Helps you consistently make progress</li>
      <li>Framework for assistance</li>
      <li>Facilitates cohort interaction</li>
      <li>Helps minimize mental fatigue</li>
      <li>Helps develop skill at troubleshooting</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
<h6>Communication</h6>
<p>Throughout the program communication within your cohort and with instructors will impact the quality of your experience. The following are the key channels of communication during your time here:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <h6>Slack</h6>
    <p>Slack will be the primary place where your cohort interacts with eachother and with staff. Because of this, we encourage you to be cognisant of what you post in Slack and follow program etiquette regarding Slack channel usage. Slack will also contain important course information. To learn more about slack, we've prepared a video that is available in a later tab.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <h6>Zoom</h6>
    <p>Zoom will be the platform used for all of our live video interaction. This tool will facilitate lectures and any other sessions that rely on video interaction. More information on Zoom is available in a later tab.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <h6>GitHub</h6>
    <p>Github serves as a public storage location of work you've done. It is an important way to interact with other developers both professionally and recreationally, allowing easy sharing and viewing of work. Throughout the program you will be using GitHub to make your work available to students and instructors to look at.</p>
  </li>
</ul>
