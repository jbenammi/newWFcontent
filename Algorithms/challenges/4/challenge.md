Hey All!

Weekly Algorithm Challenges coming at you! Remember, these algorithms cover a broad range of topics and difficulties, if you only can get 1 or 2, that is okay! These algorithms are intended to be discussed in the algorithm slack channel and a review video of these will be coming out on Friday.

#1) Skyline Heights
Lovely Burbank has a breathtaking view of the Los Angeles skyline. Let’s say you are given an array with heights of consecutive buildings, starting closest to you and extending away. Array [-1,7,3] would represent three buildings: first is actually out of view below street level, behind it is second at 7 stories high, third is 3 stories high (hidden behind the 7-story). You are situated at street level. Return array containing heights of buildings you can see, in order. Given [-1,1,1,7,3] return [1,7]. Given [0,4] return [4]. As always with challenges, do not use built-in array functions such as unshift().

#2) Poor Kenny & What Really Happened
Kenny tries to stay safe, but somehow everyday something happens. If there is a 10% chance of volcano, 15% chance of tsunami, 20% chance of earthquake, 25% chance of blizzard, and 30% chance of meteor strike, write function whatHappensToday() to print the outcome.  

Kyle (smarter than Kenny) notes that the chance of one disaster is totally unrelated to the chance of another. Change whatHappensToday() function to create whatReallyHappensToday(). In this new function test for each disaster independently, instead of assuming exactly one disaster will happen. In other words, with this new function, all five might occur today – or none. Maybe Kenny will survive!


#3) rotateString
Create a standalone function that accepts a string and an integer, and rotates the characters in the string to the right by that amount. Example: given ("Boris Godunov",5), you should return "dunovBoris Go".

#4) map() & reduce()
Implement versions of the built in Array.reduce(callback) and Array.map(callback) methods that take an array as a parameter. For examples of how these methods should function, see w3schools references on the two functions: https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/jsref_reduce.asp && https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/jsref_map.asp


See ya on slack!
