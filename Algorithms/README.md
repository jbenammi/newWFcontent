# Algorithm materials

## Overview

This directory contains materials relevant to the online post-bootcamp algorithm curriculum. The PBAC's goal is to provide the skills to '#BSCS'. What this means is high-level concepts and vocabulary which will allow students to understand the importance of different data structures and ideally be prepared for both interviews and further preparation for interviews. This should provide a framework for students to dive deeper into concepts.

- 3 Algorithms **prompts** to introduce DS
- A **walkthrough** solution to each prompt on a whiteboard
- and advanced **video** on the topic, possibly a group chat
- 3 Advanced algorithm **prompts**
- 3 **walkthroughs** of adv. prompts
