Hey Everybody!

A video! When you see JQuery+AJAX for the first time:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ICbG8LUDwaQ

Phew! What a week! Yellow belts. JavaScript. JQuery. Asynchronous JavaScript And XML. Application Programming Interfaces. Callbacks. JSON. Y'all, we've covered a lot of ground over the past 3 weeks. If you don't believe me, read some articles (https://medium.mybridge.co/@Mybridge, check out CSS/Web Dev/JavaScript pages) and think about how much more you understand today than you did 3 weeks ago! What's crazy is if you do that again in a week, you'll understand even MOAR! As far as where we are at right now, next week is going to be a lot of fun stuff, you'll build some games, we'll look at upping our front-end game the easy way, and talk about a snake!
