Hey All!

It's week 3! Time to JavaScript! Thank you to everybody that responded to the weekly recap email. Also hope y'alls' yellow belts went well. So, some thoughts on recap responses!

1) I got a few inquiries about floats and why I advise against using them. First, floating is a technique of just having an element move as far as it can to the left or right and have content flow around it. And that is the best way to use floats, to wrap text around an image or something. So, why not to use it for layout? floating an element removes it from the normal flow of the document. What this means is that you have to write code telling nearby elements how to behave if an element floats up to it. This can be tricky and typically involves some version of the 'clearfix-hack'. This is the biggest reason I think it is better to use inline-block or flexbox to avoid using floats, the behavior is much more predictable. Ultimately, floats are used in industry(that will change over next year or so I think as flexbox and CSS templates become more mainstream), so after yellow belt feel free to explore using them if you feel comfortable.

2) The other thing I saw was people being overwhelmed by the scale of yellowbelts and assignments. My advice on this is to step back and think about what you do know how to do, and then break what you are trying to do into smaller steps that  you can figure out how to do. When breaking down an image for example, maybe you plot empty divs to get things inteh right spots and then fill those divs in. Or if you are working in JS and need to do a bunch of things to an input, break it down into smaller steps and make sure each step is performing as you intended it to.

Hopefully that addressed what I was seeing to some extent. This is what we will be working on this week!
