Hey All!

It is week 4! The last week of Web Fun. I hope everybody had a nice weekend working on finishing up yellow belts and practicing JQuery. This week should be a bit slower paced than the previous as we aren't having a bunch of new information thrown our direction. Thank you to everybody that responded to the weekly recap email this weekend and that got me a yellow belt.

First, I received some questions about the github organization. As far as that goes, I've sent invites to the github accounts I know of. If you haven't gotten an invite yet, try visiting https://github.com/CodingDojoonline-April17 and you should be alerted to accept an invite. If that doesn't happen and you would like access to the organization slack me your username and I can reinvite you.

As for what we are doing this week:

Monday:
  - Algorithm Challenge Email
Tuesday:
  - RWD and CSS Frameworks
Wednesday:
  - Github Contact Card Walkthrough
Thursday:
  - PACMAN!
Friday:
  - Algo recap

Alright y'all, have fun this week and I'll catch you tomorrow!

Cheers,
Alan
