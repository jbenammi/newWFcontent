Random Closing Thoughts
Take the yellow belt regardless of where you think you are at. It will be a great benchmark for you to get an idea of where you actually are at. Submit whatever you have gotten to at the end of the time period. And then finish it! Bring it up to a 10/10. Post yellow-belt, send me that response email, I would like to know how you feel. :)

With that, I'll get out of your virtual hair and let you be. Have a fantastic weekend of learning and developing! I am looking forward to next week! We are gonna things move around!

Cheers,
Alan Weber
